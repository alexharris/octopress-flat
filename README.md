Octopress Flat
==========
Octopress Flat is a "Flat UI"-inspired theme for [Octopress](http://octopress.org). It is pretty rough at this point, and not thoroughly tested, so feel free to make improvements or let me know if you find anything broken.

Ideally, it will eventually allow each post to have a unique color theme, but I have to figure out how to do that first.

Check out the theme on my personal blog [here](http://blog.alexharr.is).
